The source lyrics are to be used as inspiration to create a new song.
The sample song you create only needs a title, verse, and chorus.
Songs should not be filthy or ambiguous. Refrain from using any profanity or suggestive lyrics.
Silly and absurd the lyrics are preferred in the output.

*Import Notes*
You can only use the provided song, do not use other outside references. You must provide a title, verse, chorus, and reason why you came up with these lyrics.

Matching Chorus: "Drove to fast and went to far"
