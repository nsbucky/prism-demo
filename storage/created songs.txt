        Title:
Lyrics:

Soy un perdedor!
I'm a loser, baby
So why don't you kill me?
(everybody)
Soy un perdedor!
I'm a loser, baby
So why don't you kill me?

Hey!

I am I am I am
I said I wanna get next to you
I said I'm gonna get close to you
You wouldn't want me have to hurt you, too
Hurt you, too

I know you want what's on my mind
I know you like what's on my mind
I know it eats you up inside
I know you know, you know, you know

Here I come I come I come I come
Here I come I come I come

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feelin' I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard!

Help me! I broke apart my insides
Help me! I've got no soul to sell
Help me! the only thing that works for me
Help me get away from myself

I wanna (poit) you like an animal
I wanna feel you from the inside
I wanna (bonk) you like an animal
My whole existence is flawed
You get me closer to God

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

You bang bang bang bang bang
Blame blame blame
You bang bang bang bang bang
It's not my thing so let it go

'Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able to make it enough for
you to be open wide
No!
And every time you speak her name does she know how you told me you'd hold me
until you died?
'Til you died?
Well you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me
You oughta know

Hey!

Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
And someone will say what is lost can never be saved
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage

I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely, too
When you don't know yourself

I don't owe you anything!
I don't owe you anything!
I don't owe you anything!
I don't owe you anything

Black Hole Sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black Hole Sun
Won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black Hole Sun! Black Hole Sun!
Won't you come?
Black Hole Sun! Black Hole Sun!
Won't you come?
Black Hole Sun! Black Hole Sun!

Do you have the time
To listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one those
Melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone
No doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up
I think I'm cracking up
And am I just paranoid
Or am I just stoned?
Or am I just stoned?

Hey!


Response:
Based on your prompt, I'll help you create a parody song in the style of Weird Al Yankovic. Since you provided the lyrics "I’m a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?" as a starting point, I'll use them to inspire a new song.

Here's a potential completion of your song:

Title: "I'm a Fries Baby, So Why Don't You Dip Me?"

Verse 1:
I'm a fries baby, so why don't you dip me?
Every single day, it's the same old plea
I'm a crispy delight, but nobody wants to eat
A sad, soggy fate, is what I constantly repeat

Chorus:
Soy un frites!
I'm a fries baby, so why don't you dip me?
(everybody)
Soy un frites!
I'm a fries baby, so why don't you dip me?

Hey!

I am I am I am
I said I wanna be part of your snack time crew
I said I'm gonna get close to the cheese sauce too
You wouldn't want me have to sit alone in my paper bag, feeling blue

I know you love what's on my bun
I know you like my toppings, one by one
I know it makes you happy inside
I know you know, you know, you know

Here I come I come I come I come
Here I come I come I come

'Cause all I wanna do is get devoured by your appetite
I got a feelin' I'm not the only snack to excite
All I wanna do is get devoured by your appetite
I got a feelin' I'm not the only snack to excite

Until the last crumb falls off my plate!

Help me! I'm all out of seasonings
Help me! My flavor's fading away, it's such a tragedy
Help me get back in the game before it's too late!
Help me avoid being yesterday's leftovers!

I wanna (sprinkle) you like a secret ingredient
I wanna be part of your mealtime desire
I wanna (dip) you like a chip in my favorite sauce
My whole existence is a flavor to explore

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

You crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch
Oh, the joy that I bring
You crunch crunch crunch crunch crunch
A delicious life, with every single bite!

'Cause the love that we share that we made wasn't enough for you to eat me all at once
No!
And every time you take a bite does it make you feel more complete?
'Til you're done?

And I'm here to remind you
Of the perfect pairing we make when we meet
It's not fair to deny my crunchy delight
Of the flavors that combine, day and night

Hey!

Despite all my hopes, I am still just a snack in your hand
Despite all my dreams, I am still just a snack in your land
And someone will say what's lost can never be savored again
Despite all my hopes, I am still just a snack in your hand

Lyrics:

Your butt is wide, well mine is too
Just watch your mouth or I'll sit on you
The word is out, better treat me right
'Cause I'm the king of cellulite
Ham on, ham on, ham on whole wheat, all right

My zippers bust, my buckles break
I'm too much man for you to take
The pavement cracks when I fall down
I've got more chins than Chinatown

Well, I've never used a phone booth
And I've never seen my toes
When I'm goin' to the movies
I take up seven rows

Because I'm fat, I'm fat, sha mone
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
Don't you call me pudgy, portly or stout
Just now tell me once again who's fat

When I walk out to get my mail
It measures on the Richter scale
Down at the beach I'm a lucky man
I'm the only one who gets a tan
If I have one more pie a la mode
I'm gonna need my own zip code

When you're only having seconds
I'm a' having twenty-thirds
When I go to get my shoes shined
I gotta take their word

Because I'm fat, I'm fat, sha mone
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
And my shadow weighs a' forty-two pounds
Lemme tell you once again who's fat

If you see me comin' your way
Better give me plenty space
If I tell you that I'm hungry
Then won't you feed my face

Because I'm fat, I'm fat, sha mone
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat.)
When I sit around the house
I really sit around the house

You know I'm fat, I'm fat, sha mone
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know, you know, you know, come on
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
And you know all by myself I'm a crowd
Lemme tell you once again

You know I'm huge, I'm fat, you know it
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, you know, woo
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know
(Fat, fat, really really fat)
And the whole world knows I'm fat and I'm proud
Just tell me once again who's fat

I'd be happy to help you complete your song lyrics. Based on the prompt "Can you help me complete some song lyrics?
I want to write a song in the style of Weird Al Yankovic" and the starting lines "I smell like tuna, is it because I'm so fat?", I'll use the inspiration from the provided sample song by Weird Al Yankovic.

Here's a possible completion for your song:

Title: "The Tuna Smell"

Verse:
I smell like tuna, is it because I'm so fat?
Maybe it's the leftover pizza in my cat
I ate the whole box of donuts for breakfast this week
And now I'm pretty sure my stomach's gonna shriek

Chorus:
But I'll just blame it on the tuna, yeah!
'Cause that's what they say when you're feeling blue
You can't take away my love for tuna fish
I'll eat it by the can, it's my favorite wish!
