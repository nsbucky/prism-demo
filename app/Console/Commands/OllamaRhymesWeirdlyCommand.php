         * Why Process Prompts Before Embedding?
         * Improved Semantic Similarity: Embedding models aim to capture the meaning of text. 1 Noise like stop words,
         * capitalization differences, and punctuation can sometimes obscure the core semantic content, leading to less
         * accurate similarity comparisons with your document embeddings.
         */

        /*
         * Lowercasing: Generally Recommended. Converting the entire prompt to lowercase ensures that the embedding
         * model doesn't treat "Search" and "search" as different concepts. This is a simple but often effective step.
         *
         * Stop Word Removal: Consider Carefully. Removing common words like "the," "a," "is," "and" can sometimes be
         * helpful by focusing the embedding on more content-rich terms. However, stop words can also contribute to the
         * overall meaning and context of a query. Removing them aggressively might lead to the loss of important nuances,
         * especially in shorter queries. It's often better to rely on the embedding model's ability to weigh the
         * importance of different words. You might experiment with and without stop word removal to see what works best
         * for your specific data and use case.
         *
         * Punctuation Removal: Generally Recommended. Punctuation marks usually don't contribute significantly to the
         * semantic meaning for retrieval purposes. Removing them can simplify the input for the embedding model.
         *
         * Stemming/Lemmatization: Consider Carefully. These techniques reduce words to their root form
         * (e.g., "running" to "run," "better" to "good"). While they can help in document embedding by grouping similar concepts,
         *  they might be less crucial for query embedding.
         *
         * User queries are often already in a relatively concise form. Over-aggressive stemming/lemmatization on
         * queries could even alter the intended meaning.
         *
         * Special Character Removal: Generally Recommended (with caution). Removing irrelevant special characters can
         * be beneficial. However, be careful not to remove characters that might be part of a specific search term
         * (e.g., hashtags, code snippets).
